Features:

Data Upload and Format Support: Users should be able to upload data in various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases, etc.).

Data Cleaning: This includes handling missing values (delete or impute), removing duplicates, stripping extra spaces, etc.

Data Transformation: Features like normalization/standardization, categorical encoding (like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding), binning, etc.

Feature Engineering: Providing options for creating new features from existing ones, such as polynomial features, interaction terms, etc.

Data Visualization: Automatic generation of charts and plots to help users understand the distributions and relationships in their data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provide summary statistics of the data, correlation analysis, and outlier detection.

Data Export: After preprocessing, users should be able to export the processed data for use in their own machine learning models or other analysis tools.

Data Storage: Allow users to save their processed datasets directly in the app for future use.

Integration with Machine Learning Libraries: Users could directly train basic machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

Data Validation: Check for data inconsistencies and errors, with the ability to report back to the user.

User Profiles: Allow users to save their preprocessing configurations to easily reapply them to new datasets.

Batch Processing: If the user has multiple files that need to be processed in the same way, batch processing would be a great feature.

Date and Time Parsing: Dates and times can be especially tricky to handle and are common in many datasets. Having automatic recognition and parsing for these could be very helpful.

Text Preprocessing: If the dataset contains text data, you could offer features for tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and other NLP tasks.

API: Provide an API so other applications or advanced users can access your service programmatically.
